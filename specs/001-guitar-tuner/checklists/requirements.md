## Notes

**Validation Date**: December 8, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED - All quality criteria met

The specification successfully passes all validation checks:
- Contains no implementation details, maintaining appropriate abstraction
- All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific measurable metrics (time, frequency, accuracy percentages)
- Three prioritized user stories (P1, P1, P2) cover core functionality
- 10 edge cases identified covering various scenarios
- Scope clearly bounded to 6-string guitar tuning with preset options

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
